# LightStep for Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph extension that shows information from LightStep in OpenTracing instrumentation code.

**NOTE:** Using this extension on private code in the Sourcegraph browser extension requires a self-hosted Sourcegraph instance (because it needs access to the contents of the current file).
