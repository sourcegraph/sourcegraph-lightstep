# LightStep for Sourcegraph

## ⚠️ Deprecation notice

**Sourcegraph extensions have been deprecated with the September 2022 Sourcegraph
release. [Learn more](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/extensions/deprecation).**

The repo and the docs below are kept to support older Sourcegraph versions.

## Description

A [Sourcegraph extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/extensions) that lets you view live traces on [LightStep](https://lightstep.com) for [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io) spans in your code.

[**🗃️ Source code**](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-lightstep)

[**➕ Add to Sourcegraph**](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/lightstep) (see [usage instructions](#usage) for self-hosted Sourcegraph instances)

## Features

Works on [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com) and [self-hosted Sourcegraph instances](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#quickstart).

- **Live traces on LightStep** link decoration on lines containing OpenTracing start span calls

## Usage

1. Enable the `sourcegraph/lightstep` extension:
   - On Sourcegraph.com, visit [https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/lightstep](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/lightstep) to enable it.
   - On a self-hosted Sourcegraph instance, select **User menu > Extensions**, search for `sourcegraph/lightstep`, and enable it.
1. Visit any code file containing an OpenTracing start span call. (If the extension needs configuration, it will say so on lines containing OpenTracing calls and in the file header.)
1. Click on the **Live traces (LightStep)** link that appears at the end of the line of each OpenTracing start span call to open the LightStep live traces page for that operation.

## Roadmap

- Support more patterns for OpenTracing span starts. The current regexp for matching these is quite simple.
- Add at-a-glance summary about a span in a hover message.
- Display all spans in the current file, tree, and repository.
- Support usage in the [Sourcegraph browser extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension).
- Link to LightStep queries for tags and other properties of a span.
- Show all recent tag values for a span (for all tags, and for each tag defined in a call).
- Show spans that contain a given span.
